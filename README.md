# LinearRegression
I compute a linear regression algorithm myself, and I also use LinearRegression from Sklearn library to compare my result<br/>
The part that I implement my own linear regression model is in the class CustomLinearRegression(), which using normal equation to calculate the coefficient. Each function is explained in the code.<br/>
Then I use the sklearn library to calculate the coefficient, intercept, r2 score and rmse score then I show the difference of result between my model and sklearn model
